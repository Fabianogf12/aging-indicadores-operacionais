A tool designed to support the Backoffice Operation (CRC/JEC), providing
a clear view of Aging, automated deadline classification, visual alerts,
and high-quality operational indicators.

The goal is to reduce rework, ensure deadlines, improve daily
monitoring, and strengthen performance results (5 Stars / Variable
Bonus).

## 🎯 Project Objective

-   Monitor Aging with accuracy and clarity\
-   Support CRC/JEC deadline compliance\
-   Enable daily prioritization using updated data\
-   Improve decision-making through operational visibility\
-   Reduce errors and increase performance consistency

## 🧠 Why This Project Exists

The Backoffice Operation heavily depends on meeting deadlines and
analyzing daily Aging.\
Without standardization, risks include:

-   missed deadlines\
-   increased rework\
-   higher legal exposure\
-   reduced 5-Star indicator performance\
-   loss of control over Aging average

This project was created to:

-   standardize the analysis\
-   reduce operational errors\
-   provide agility and clarity\
-   increase reliability for operators and managers

## ✨ Main Features

✔ Automatic Aging calculation (Days Open)\
✔ Conditional deadline classification\
✔ Visual highlights for urgent cases\
✔ Integrated legend (green, yellow, orange, red)\
✔ Global Aging average calculation\
✔ Notes column for each case\
✔ Status categories: *Within Deadline, Attention, Urgent, Due Today,
Overdue*\
✔ Professional layout inspired by TIM branding

## 🎨 Deadline Classification Rules

  Range             Days        Color
  ----------------- ----------- --------------
  Within deadline   0--3 days   🟢 Green
  Attention         4--5 days   🟡 Yellow
  Urgent            6--8 days   🟠 Orange
  Due today         9 days      🔴 Light Red
  Overdue           ≥ 10 days   🔴 Red

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

-   Excel\
-   Conditional Formatting\
-   Functions: `IF`, `COUNTIF`, custom rules\
-   Layout inspired by TIM brand guidelines\
-   Internal process automation using formulas

## 🚀 How to Use
